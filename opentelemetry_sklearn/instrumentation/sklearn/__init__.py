class SklearnInstrumentor:
    """Instrument a fitted sklearn model with opentelemetry spans.

    Instrument methods of ``BaseEstimator``-derived components in a sklearn
    model.  The assumption is that a machine learning model ``Pipeline`` (or
    class descendent) is being instrumented with opentelemetry. Within a
    ``Pipeline`` is some hierarchy of estimators and transformers.

    The ``instrument_estimator`` method walks this hierarchy of estimators,
    implementing each of the defined methods with its own span.

    Certain estimators in the sklearn ecosystem contain other estimators as
    class attributes. Support for walking this embedded sub-hierarchy is
    supported with the recurse attribute. This attribute is a dictionary
    with classes as keys, and a tuple of attributes representing embedded
    ``BaseEstimator`` s. By default, the recurse dictionary is empty.

    Similar to Pipelines, there are also estimators which have class attributes
    as a list of 2-tuples, for instance the FeatureUnion and its attribute
    ``transformer_list``. Support for walking this sub-hierarchy is also
    supported through the ``recurse_namedtuple_attribs`` attribute. By
    default, the ``recurse_namedtuple_attribs`` dictionary supports
    ``Pipeline`` with ``steps``, and ``FeatureUnion`` with
    ``transformer_list``.

    Note that spans will not be generated for any child transformer whose
    parent transformer has ``n_jobs`` parameter set to anything besides
    ``None`` or ``1``.

    Example:

        from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

        X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)
        X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y)

            [
                ("class", RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)),

        )

        model.fit(X_train, y_train)

    Args:
        methods (list): A list of method names on which to instrument a span.
          This list of methods will be checked on all estimators in the model
          hierarchy.
        recurse_attribs (dict): A dictionary of ``BaseEstimator``-derived
          sklearn classes as keys, with values being a list of attributes. Each
          attribute represents either an estimator or list of estimators on
          which to also implement spans. An example is
          ``RandomForestClassifier`` and its attribute ``estimators_``
        recurse_namedtuple_attribs (dict): A dictionary of ``BaseEstimator``-
          derived sklearn types as keys, with values being a list of
          attribute names. Each attribute represents a list of 2-tuples in
          which the first element is the estimator name, and the second
          element is the estimator. Defaults include sklearn's ``Pipeline``
          and its attribute ``steps``, and the ``FeatureUnion`` and its
          attribute ``transformer_list``.
